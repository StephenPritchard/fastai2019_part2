# fastai2019_part2

In this repo I will be following along with part2 of the fastai deep learning course, where the aim is to recreate much of the fastai library and some of pytorch from scratch.

Course website: https://course.fast.ai/part2

I used anaconda to setup my environment, can see the imports required in environment.yml. If you have anaconda installed, you can clone this repo, and in the main directory, execute `$ conda env create` and it should automatically conda install all the packages listed in the environment.yml file.
